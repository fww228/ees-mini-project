# ees-mini-project

This is the mini project assessment of Earth & Environmental Science class.

## Requirement

**DDL: 29 April**

You should return a 1000 word report on your approach and results, providing suitable figures and data visualisation. You may use any coding language or software you prefer but your code should be supplied in an executable format.

## Description

Using the daily temperature record from the Durham observatory (for the period 1901 to end of 2019) predict the daily temperature for 2020. You may use any technique you prefer.

## Dataset

The dataset 'temp.csv' is a single .csv file. That gives the date as single format and as separated by year, month and day of the year. The data is then given as the daily rainfall (PPT); average daily temperature (the average of Tmax and Tmin); the minimum daily temperature (Tmin); and the daily maximum temperature (Tmax).
The data is recorded at 9am each morning at Observatory Hill in Durham. It is the average temperature that you should model.
